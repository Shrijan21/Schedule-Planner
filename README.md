# Schedule-Planner

This is a Full Stack Web App.

It is like a To-Do-List App in which you can schedule your daily targets to accomplish them wisely.
You can navigate to multiple pages and create new collection in database for yourself.
To use this project, you can fork this project on your pc and run it on your localhost page to make your own day-to-day Schedule.

I have used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT to do the Frontend part
and, Mongoose, EJS and Node.js to Complete the Backend work.
